# spatula

Scrape semantically identifiable data from recipe web pages
for purposes of linking and importing into supporting applications.

#### Concept started 11/5/2020

Had the wild idea.  Then just learned about `JSON-LD` and `schema.org/Recipe`
semantic ontology. Set up this project for experimental purposes.

That's all for now, folks!
